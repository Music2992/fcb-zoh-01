I joined zuit because I knew that coding will help me to earn with work life balance.

Coding is one of the skill that you can earn more if you master it.

I am highly motivated and excited to learn coding and earn a stable income thru coding.

Based on my experience, If people saw you coding some stuff on your computer they will think that you can hack facebook.

But coding is used for creating website, and of 
Indemand jobs ing IT Industry.

I hope to learn more about coding.

Thank you.
